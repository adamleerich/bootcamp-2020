How to develop a presentation
==================================

Give each presentation its own subfolder of *presentations*.
Every presentation has its own Rproj.
Just put everything that presentation needs in its folder.
When you need to *build* the slides, run this at the command line
from the folder you are working in:

    ..\..\build.bat filename.Rmd

    + BIC
    + RMSE
    + Mallow's Cp
    + Cook's distance
    + Outliers
    + Leverage points and hat matrix

* Capstone changes:
    + Reduce limits so students see a difference in expected costs

* Correlation plots

* Cullen-Frey?

* `rpart` instead of `tree` package
