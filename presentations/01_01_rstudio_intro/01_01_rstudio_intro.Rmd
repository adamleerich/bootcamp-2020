# Let's get started

## Basics

* RStudio setup
* Saving and sourcing scripts
* RStudio projects

## In general

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/options_general.png')
```

## Keeping up appearances

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/options_appearance.png')
```

## It panes me to say it

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/options_pane_layout.png')
```

<!-- * What they all do -->
<!-- * Change the location of the panes -->

## Basic operations

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 5
-2 ^ 0.5 # which operator takes precedence
sqrt(2)
abs(-15.4)
3 > 4 # logical
```

## Objects

```{r}
my_name <- "Brian"
my_name
my_age <- 48
my_age
```

## Naming objects

* Clarity <> brevity
    * `loss_ratio` > `lr`
    * The time you save typing will be spent debugging
* Autocomplete is your friend
    * You won't have to type complete words
* Use noun, then modifier, as in Spanish (auto roja)
    * `premium_earned` > `earned_premium`
    * `rate_increase_texas` > `texas_rate_increase`
* Nouns for objects, verbs for functions
* Pick a convention and stick with it.

## The pipe

Found in the `magrittr` package. 

CTRL+SHIFT+M in RStudio

```{r}
exp(sqrt(pi))
library(magrittr)

pi %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  exp()
```

## Help

```{r eval=FALSE}
?plot
??cluster
```

Youll find loads of help on the internet. Two good options:

* [Stack Overflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

## Code execution

CTRL+ENTER

90% of your code writing and execution will be done in scripts. Use the console for getting help or one-off operations like: package installation, light debugging.

## Speaking of debugging

R has a debugging framework. I rarely use it.

The combination of environment pane and REPL does 98% of what I need. YMMV

## Keyboard shortcuts

* ALT+SHIFT+K

| Shortcut      | Result            |
|---------------|-------------------|
| ALT+-         | `<-`              |
| CTRL+ENTER    |  Execute a line   |
| CTRL+1        | Go to source pane |
| CTRL+2        | Go to console     |
| CTRL+SHIFT+M  | ` %>% `           |
| CTRL+L        | Clear the console |
| CTRL+SHIFT+N  | New script        |
| CTRL+W        | Close this tab    |
| CTRL+SHIFT+F  | Find in files     |
| CTRL+SHIFT+B  | Build             |


## The working directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

You will probably never have a good reason to call `setwd()`. Use a project instead.

## Working directory in RStudio

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/working_directory.png')
```

## Projects

* Collect all of the files relevant to a project
* Automatically set the working directory 
* Intermediate stuff:
  * Version control
  * Package development
  * CTRL-SHIFT-B
  
Let's all create one now.

## Project directory in RStudio

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/project_directory.png')
```

## Directory paths

* Windows paths are constructed with the backward slash "\\" separator
* mac, *nix machines construct paths with the forward slash "/" separator
* Furthermore, in R, the backward slash "\\" is used for things like tabs and newline characters
* If you really need a slash and aren't intending to "escape" the next character, just type it twice
* Foreshadowing: For a painless, OS-independent approach to constructing paths to files, use the `file.path()` function

## Installing and using packages

This should have been done before you got here. Quick review.

* Packages are additional code libraries
* The must be installed in order to be loaded
* They must be loaded in order to be used

## Installation vs. library

1. `install.packages()` copies files to your computer.
2. `library()` finds those files and loads them into memory.
3. When you turn off your computer, the files are unloaded from memory.
4. Files on your computer don't disappear when you turn off your computer.

## Package installation folder

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

## Avoidable rookie mistakes

* Typing code in the console rather than a script
* Calling `setwd()` in a script
* Saving the workspace
* Looking at the "History" tab
* Not using RStudio projects
* Forgetting to add a call to `library()` for a package that you need
* Assuming that you can name objects whatever you like
* Assuming that coding style has no value

## Exercise

1. Create a project to use during the bootcamp.
1. Create a folder in that project called 'data'.
3. Create a script which executes the line `1 + 1`.
4. Execute that script.
