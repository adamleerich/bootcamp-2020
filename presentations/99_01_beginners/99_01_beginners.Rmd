```





## Where are RStudio & R?

* Available on Citrix
* Install it yourself if you have a DEV virtual machine
* You can install portable versions on a **Surface device**





## RStudio Basics

* Panes
* Editor versus console
* Shortcut keys
* Getting help 
    + `?`
    + function without `()`
* Use projects





## Basic operations

These work as expected, e.g., like Excel does.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 + 5
-2 ^ 0.5
sqrt(2)
abs(-15.4)
3 > 4
10 %% 4
123 / 12
pi
exp(1)
```





## Keyboard shortcuts


| Shortcut      | Result            |
|---------------|-------------------|
| CTRL+ENTER    |  Execute a line   |
| CTRL+1        | Go to source pane |
| CTRL+2        | Go to console     |
| CTRL+L        | Clear the console |
| CTRL+SHIFT+N  | New script        |
| CTRL+W        | Close this tab    |
| CTRL+SHIFT+M  | ` %>% `           |
| ALT+-         | `<-`              |








## The working directory

Code that relies on these will probably break, so be careful.

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
setwd('w:/CrossBusiness/FSU/other')
epl <- read.csv('epl.csv')
```

```{r}
epl <- read.csv('W:/CrossBusiness/FSU/other/epl.csv')
```






## Directory paths

* Windows paths are constructed with the backward slash "\\" separator
* mac, *nix machines construct paths with the forward slash "/" separator
* Furthermore, in R, the backward slash "\\" is used for things like tabs and newline characters
* If you really need a slash and aren't intending to "escape" the next character, just type it twice

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
dir('w:/CrossBusiness/FSU/Public D&O')
dir('w:\\CrossBusiness\\FSU\\Public D&O')
```







## Installing and using packages

* Packages are additional code libraries
* The must be installed in order to be loaded
* They must be loaded in order to be used





## Installation vs. `library`

1. `install.packages()` copies files to your computer
2. `library()` finds those files and loads them into memory
3. You only have to install a package once, and it is available forever
4. You will need to use `library` to load needed packages **once each session**




## Rdata and Rhistory files

```{r eval=FALSE}
save(epl, file = 'epl.Rdata')
load('epl.Rdata')
```

**`.RData` and `.Rhistory` are automatically created for you** when you
close RStudio.





## Variables

Like in all programming languages, we will use **variable names** to refer
to the results of calculations or the output of function calls.

### Rules for variable names:

  * Can include letters, numbers, underscores, and dots
  * Cannot start with a number or underscore
  * Names can start with a dot, but they will be hidden
  * R is case-sensitive




## Assigning values to variables

  * You can give any object, value, data, etc. a name.
  * **Use the `<-` operator** to do so.
  * You don't have to tell R what kind of data you will store in that name.
  * And, you can use the name for something else later, if you want.
  * (Other languages won't allow you to do this)




## Examples

```{r}
insureds <- c('Hair by Brian', 'Rich Family Farm', 'R Programmers R Us')
premium <- c(1000, 2000, 3000)
claim_count <- c(0L, 1L, 0L)
claim_desc <- c(NA, "Goat ate the chicken feed", NA)
```

* These are all vectors
* The `c()` function *concatenates* values into vectors
* `insureds` is a character vector
* `premium` is a numeric vector
* `claim_count` is an integer vector
* You can use single or double quotes for character strings
  




## What variables are in use?

How can you tell what variables are already being used?

* `ls()`
* Also, `search()` tells you what packages are loaded to memory



## Vector functions

There are 1000s of functions that you can run on vectors.
Here are a few that you will use all the time,
on all types of objects.

* Structure: `str`
* `length`
* `print`
* `sum`
* `mean`
* `is.na`




## Create a vector using `seq`

The `seq` function is used often to generate a sequence of values.
The colon operator `:` is a shortcut for a sequence of integers.

```{r }
pies <- seq(from = 0, by = pi, length.out = 5)
i <- 1:5
year <- 2000:2004
```




## Vector indexing by position

You can pull values out of vectors using **indexing**.
Remember, ':' is shorthand to generate a sequence.

```{r }
nums <- 1:100
nums[20]
nums[20:30]
nums[c(10, 20, 30, 40)]
```




## Vector indexing with logicals

Vectors may be accessed logically.
This may be done by passing in a logical vector, or a logical expression.

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r }
i <- 5:9
i[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
i[i > 7]
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{r }
b <- i > 7
b
i[b]
```
:::
::::::::::::::









## Vector arithmetic

Arithmetic operations on vectors work element-wise.
If there aren't enough, R will recycle the short ones.
Like `B0` and `B1` in the following code, they are "scalars".


```{r eval=FALSE}
N <- 10e3
B0 <- 5
B1 <- 1.5

e <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
X1 <- sample(-10:10, size = N, replace = TRUE)

Y <- B0 + B1 * X1 + e
```






## The `%in%` operator

The `%in%` operator will return a logical vector indicating whether or not an element of the first set is contained in the second set.

```{r }
x <- 1:10
y <- 5:15
x %in% y
```






## Summarization

Loads of functions take vector input and return scalar output.
Here are a few more...

```{r eval=FALSE}
x = 1:50
sum(x)
mean(x)
max(x)
length(x)
var(x)
```






## Data Frames

A data frame is like a table.
It can have as many rows and columns as you need.
Each column is a vector, and all the vectors have the same length.

```{r}
claims_data <- data.frame(insureds, premium, claim_count, claim_desc)
print(claims_data)
```



## Another data frame

```{r}
policies <- data.frame(
  pol_number = 1:10,
  prem = c(100, 110, 90, 120, 115, 60, 300, 30, 100, 95),
  age = c(21, 22, 32, 54, 34, 19, 70, 54, 42, NA)
)
```

  * Note the differences between this and the last slide
  * Pay attention to `<-` and `=`




## Functions for data frames

* `str`
* `names`
* `print`
* `head`
* `summary`



## Data frame subsetting and indexing

```{r}
teams  <- c("Toronto", "New York", "Baltimore", "Tampa Bay", "Boston")
wins   <- c(93, 87, 81, 80, 78)
losses <- c(69, 75, 81, 82, 84)

alEast <- data.frame(Team = teams, W = wins, L = losses)
```





## Selecting rows and columns

```{r, eval=FALSE}
alEast[1, ]
alEast[, 2]
alEast[, c('W', 'L')]
alEast[3] 
alEast[c(T, T, F, F, F), ]
alEast[alEast$Team == 'New York', ]
```

What happens on the last one if you leave off the comma?







## Other data structures

Most of the data you will be working with in R will be one of the following

+ data.frame
+ vector
+ list
  
You will also see some matrices and factors, but let's skip those for now.




## Okay, so what is a list, then?

+ A list is a bag of stuff
+ Everything in the list has an index (1, 2, 3, etc.)
+ The stuff can be anything
  * vectors
  * other lists
  * special objects
  * etc.
+ **Most modeling and other complex functions return lists**



## Lists


```{r }
x <- list()
typeof(x)
x[[1]] <- c("Hello", "there", "this", "is", "a", "list")
x[[2]] <- c(pi, exp(1))
summary(x)
str(x)
```




## List names

Names are handled with the special `$` operator. `$` permits access to a single element.
(A single element of a list can be a vector!)

```{r}
y <- list()
y$Artist <- c("Lou Reed", "Patti Smith")
y$Age <- c(45, 63)
names(y)
```





## Loading Data

**Use CSV files whenever possible**
```{r}
epl <- read.csv(
  'c:/Users/richad/OneDrive - Beazley Group/Desktop/epl.csv')
str(epl)
```

You can also load directly from databases.




## CSV Gotchas

* Dates
* Strings and factors
* Missing data
* Types






## Graphics

* There are a lot of packages in R that do graphics.
* We're going to talk about two graphics systems: base graphics and `ggplot2`.
* Why both?
* **`ggplot2` makes it easier to build more customized visualizations**, 
  but it can take some time to get used to.
* However, base graphics will always have its place.  For example
    + Your basic function is `plot`.
    + It's really smart.
    + Just pass it something and it probably knows what to do with it.
    + **Most objects have a smart version of `plot`.**



## Prelims

* Load the `ggplot2` package using `include`
* Take a look at a few data sets before we start
    + `cars`
    + `iris`
* Head on over to rstudio.com and download the visualization cheatsheet

## Pipe review: `%>%`

The pipe is probably new to you.
It takes a little getting used to.
But once you get the hang of it,
it is very intuitive.

* It takes whatever is to its **left** and 
* inserts it as the first argument in the **function to its right**

Shortcut key is `CTRL-SHIFT-M`




## Pipe Example

Let's get some data.
It's close to Halloween, so how about Bram Stoker's _Dracula_?

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dracula <- readr::read_file(
  'http://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345.txt')
dracula_words <- strsplit(dracula, split = '\\s+')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dracula <- readr::read_file('dracula.txt')
dracula_words <- strsplit(dracula, split = '\\s+')
```





## Chain of functions

```{r out.height = "400px"}
words <- unlist(dracula_words)
words_lower <- tolower(words)
nchar_words <- nchar(words_lower)
nchar_words10 <- pmin(nchar_words, 10)
table_words10 <- table(nchar_words10)
barplot(table_words10, names.arg = c(1:9, '10+'))
```

That's a lot of new variables.




## Combine as one
```{r eval=FALSE}
unlist(dracula_words)
tolower(unlist(dracula_words))
nchar(tolower(unlist(dracula_words)))
pmin(nchar(tolower(unlist(dracula_words))), 10)
table(pmin(nchar(tolower(unlist(dracula_words))), 10))

# Fully nested!
barplot(table(pmin(nchar(tolower(unlist(dracula_words))), 10)), names.arg = c(1:9, '10+'))
```

That's hard to read.




## Pipe it!
```{r out.height = "400px"}
dracula_words %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  tolower() %>% 
  nchar() %>% 
  pmin(10) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  barplot(names.arg = c(1:9, '10+'))
```







## Back to `dplyr`

```{r}
library(raw)
data("MultiTri")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
str(MultiTri)
head(MultiTri)
```




## Real quick:

* What's the average IBNR for lag 2 by accident year?




## dplyr to the rescue!



| Verbs             |
|-------------------|
| select/rename     |
| mutate            |
| group             |
| arrange           |
| filter            |
| summarize         |




## `select` and `rename`

Comparable to the "select" verb in SQL.
This will return only those columns you've requested.
A "negative" column name will omit that column.

```{r}
financials <- MultiTri %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    CumulativePaid, CumulativeIncurred, IBNR)

no_lag <- MultiTri %>% 
  dplyr::select(-Lag)
```






## Identifying which columns to select

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Loads of helper functions to find columns

| function      |
|---------------|
| `contains`    |
| `starts_with` |
| `ends_with`   |
| `matches`     |
| `num_range`   |

:::
::: {.column}

```{r}
years <- MultiTri %>% 
  dplyr::select(contains("year"))
```

:::
::::::::::::::






## `rename`

Closely related to `select`.
New name on the left, old name on the right.
(Think the way that variables are usually assigned.)

```{r}
new_tri <- MultiTri %>% 
  rename(DevelopmentLag = Lag)
```





## `mutate`

Create a new column or alter an existing one.

```{r}
new_tri <- new_tri %>% 
  mutate(
    PaidToIncurred = CumulativePaid / CumulativeIncurred, 
    Upper = DevelopmentYear <= 1997)
```





## Aside: a note on assigment

**Re-using variable names invites problems**

The only time I think it is OK is when running the command more than once
gives you the **exact same results**.





## Combining operations

```{r}
new_tri <- MultiTri %>% 
  mutate(Upper = DevelopmentYear <= 1997) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-DevelopmentYear)
```






## `arrange`

```{r eval=FALSE}
MultiTri %>% 
  arrange(AccidentYear)

MultiTri %>% 
  arrange(desc(IBNR))
```

Use the `desc` function to arrange in descending order.




## `filter`


```{r}
upper_tri <- MultiTri %>% 
  dplyr::filter(DevelopmentYear <= 1997)
```

Multiple conditions are OK

```{r}
upper_tri <- MultiTri %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    DevelopmentYear <= 1997, 
    IBNR > 500)
```




## `slice`

Like `filter` but does numeric indexing
to get specific rows of data.

```{r}
every_fifth <- MultiTri %>%
  slice(seq(from = 5, by = 5, to = nrow(MultiTri)))
```





## `group_by`

This will group the data. The effect isn't material until another operation is applied.

```{r}
df_grouped <- MultiTri %>% 
  group_by(Company, AccidentYear)
```





## `summarize`

```{r}
dfBigYear <- MultiTri %>% 
  group_by(AccidentYear) %>% 
  summarize(BiggestIBNR = max(IBNR))
```






## Answer a complex question quickly

For each company
which has had paid to incurred ratio less than 40%,
which accident year had the highest P2I?





##

```{r}
dfBigCase <- MultiTri %>% 
  mutate(PaidToIncurred = CumulativePaid / CumulativeIncurred) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(PaidToIncurred < 0.4) %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  arrange(desc(PaidToIncurred)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Company, AccidentYear)
```




## What about joining?

```{r}
dfCo <- data.frame(
  Company = unique(MultiTri$Company), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dfCo$PolicyHolderSurplus <- rnorm(
  nrow(dfCo), 1e8, 0.3 * 1e8)

print(dfCo)

```




## Joining

```{r}
dfJoined <- dplyr::inner_join(MultiTri, dfCo)
dfJoined %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    Company, PolicyHolderSurplus, DevelopmentYear) %>% 
  head(3)
```





## What's `tidyr`?

Does a number of things, but I'm only going to talk about 2: spreading and gathering

```{r}
library(tidyr)
one_co <- new_tri %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    Company == unique(MultiTri$Company)[1], 
    Line == 'Workers Comp')
```





## `tidyr::spread`

```{r}
wide_tri <- one_co %>%
  dplyr::select(AccidentYear, Lag, NetEP, CumulativePaid) %>% 
  tidyr::spread(Lag, CumulativePaid)

print(wide_tri)

```




## What about missing values?

```{r}
wide_tri <- one_co %>%
  dplyr::filter(Upper) %>% 
  dplyr::select(AccidentYear, Lag, NetEP, CumulativePaid) %>% 
  spread(Lag, CumulativePaid)
wide_tri
```



## `tidyr::gather`

Note that we're _excluding_ AccidentYear and Net EP from the gathering.

```{r}
long_tri <- wide_tri %>% 
  tidyr::gather(Lag, CumulativePaid, -AccidentYear, -NetEP)
long_tri
```






## What's a tibble?

More or less a data frame.

* The print command won't try to print every row in the tibble.
* They don't automatically convert strings to factors
* add_row and add_column methods are kinda cool, especially add_row
* Some other stuff (no partial matching on column names)
