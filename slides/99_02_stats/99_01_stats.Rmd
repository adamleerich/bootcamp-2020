## Variables

Like in all programming languages, we will use **variable names** to refer
to the results of calculations or the output of function calls.

### Rules for variable names:

  * Can include letters, numbers, underscores, and dots
  * Cannot start with a number or underscore
  * Names can start with a dot, but they will be hidden
  * R is case-sensitive



Notes for next year
===========================

* Classification models
    + Confusion matrices
    + Gain and lift charts
    + K-S chart
    + ROC chart and AOC
    + http://www.saedsayad.com/model_evaluation_c.htm

* Cover more modeling and diagnostics:
    + AIC
    + BIC
    + RMSE
    + Mallow's Cp
    + Cook's distance
    + Outliers
    + Leverage points and hat matrix
    + Residual analysis


* TODO figure out how to use concepts of glms to fit theoretical severity distributions to claims data

* Capstone changes:
    + Reduce limits so students see a difference in expected costs

* Correlation plots

* Cullen-Frey?

* `rpart` instead of `tree` package

* Why were my HTML files so much bigger than Brian's?
