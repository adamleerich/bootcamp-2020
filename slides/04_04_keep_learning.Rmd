```{r include=FALSE}
source('common.R')
```






## `help`

The help pane has a home button.
That will take you to an index with a lot of cool stuff.
Some of it you can't access using `help` from the console.


Here are some examples of stuff you can get from the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Function help
?rnorm

# Package help
help(package = ggplot2)

# Specify which package to look in
?dplyr::filter

# Search help
??select

# Operator help
?`+`
?`%in%`
```






## Description files

You can access them from the `help` index
for that package.
Or, like this

```{r}
packageDescription('raw')
```





## Package websites

Some packages have them,
especially newer ones

* https://www.tidyverse.org/
* https://yihui.org/knitr/
* etc.





## github repos

The vast majority of package developers using github.
You can find the source code, links to documentation,
help pages, tutorials, etc.
Sometimes, all a package has is the README file.
If all else fails, you can always email the author.

* https://github.com/r-lib/devtools
* https://github.com/vigou3/actuar
* https://github.com/adamleerich/fancycut/
* etc.






## Galleries

* https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html
* https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/
* https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/
* https://plotly.com/ggplot2/
* etc.




## Functions source code

See the source code of functions by printing
the function without parentheses

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ChainLadder)
```

```{r}
MackChainLadder
```




## `methods`

Some functions are *generic*
meaning that they do different
things on different objects --
`plot` is one of these.

```{r}
methods(plot)
```




## Get help on a `print.*` function

```{r eval=FALSE}
?plot.<tab>
?plot.MunichChainLadder
# etc.
```




## RStudio cheatsheets

https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

* I cannot stress enough how helpful these are






## Stack Overflow    

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r

* Question and answer site
* If you have a question, it probably has already been asked here
* If you want a challenge, follow the R channel
  and try and post answers before anyone else does!





## Coursera

https://www.coursera.org/search?query=r&

* Lots of free content
* From universities:
    + Johns Hopkins
    + Duke
    + Imperial College London
    + University of California
    + University of Illinois
    + And *tons* more
* If you pay, you can earn certificates




## DataCamp

https://www.datacamp.com/learn/r-programming/

* Interactive
* Python, SQL, R, and others
* About $30 per month
* Some free content




## Codecademy

https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/r

* Very similar to DataCamp
* Lots of other languages
* About $25 per month
* More free content




##  Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions

* Data science competitions
* Lots of free data sets
* A place to learn by doing
* Not for the faint of heart
* You can earn money if you win





## Data science help

A great book by Hadley Wickham and
Garrett Grolemund from RStudio

* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/


Another resource what was just recommended to me is
the Scikit-learn website.
Scikit-learn is a Python package.
But, it has great resources for learning
data science.
You might even learn some Python along the way!

## Other R programmers

* R programmers like to help each other
* Create a community in your company
* There is probably an R users group close to you -- check meetup.com and Google
* r-bloggers.com
* Teach someone else to code in R and learn together :)
