## Variables

Like in all programming languages, we will use **variable names** to refer
to the results of calculations or the output of function calls.

### Rules for variable names:

  * Can include letters, numbers, underscores, and dots
  * Cannot start with a number or underscore
  * Names can start with a dot, but they will be hidden
  * R is case-sensitive




## Assigning values to variables

  * You can give any object, value, data, etc. a name.
  * **Use the `<-` operator** to do so.
  * You don't have to tell R what kind of data you will store in that name.
  * And, you can use the name for something else later, if you want.
  * (Other languages won't allow you to do this)




## Examples

```{r}
insureds <- c('Hair by Brian', 'Rich Family Farm', 'R Programmers R Us')
premium <- c(1000, 2000, 3000)
claim_count <- c(0L, 1L, 0L)
claim_desc <- c(NA, "Brian gave Adam's goat a bad haircut", NA)
```

* These are all vectors
* The `c()` function *concatenates* values into vectors
* `insureds` is a character vector
* `premium` is a numeric vector
* `claim_count` is an integer vector
* You can use single or double quotes for character strings
  




## What variables are in use?

How can you tell what variables are already being used?

* `ls()`
* Type the name at the command line and see what happens!
    + `num1`
    + `t`
    + `df`
    + `names`
    + `true`
  



## Vector functions

There are 1000s of functions that you can run on vectors.
Here are a few that you will use all the time,
on all types of objects.

* Structure: `str`
* `length`
* `print`
* `sum`
* `mean`
* `is.na`




## Create a vector using `seq`

The `seq` function is used often to generate a sequence of values.
The colon operator `:` is a shortcut for a sequence of integers.

```{r }
pies <- seq(from = 0, by = pi, length.out = 5)
i <- 1:5
year <- 2000:2004
```




## Vector indexing by position

You can pull values out of vectors using **indexing**.
Remember, ':' is shorthand to generate a sequence.

```{r }
nums <- 1:100
nums[20]
nums[20:30]
nums[c(10, 20, 30, 40)]
```




## Vector indexing with logicals

Vectors may be accessed logically.
This may be done by passing in a logical vector, or a logical expression.

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r }
i <- 5:9
i[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
i[i > 7]
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{r }
b <- i > 7
b
i[b]
```
:::
::::::::::::::









## Vector arithmetic

Arithmetic operations on vectors work element-wise.
If there aren't enough, R will recycle the short ones.
Like `B0` and `B1` in the following code, they are "scalars".


```{r eval=FALSE}
N <- 10e3
B0 <- 5
B1 <- 1.5

e <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
X1 <- sample(-10:10, size = N, replace = TRUE)

Y <- B0 + B1 * X1 + e
```






## The `%in%` operator

The `%in%` operator will return a logical vector indicating whether or not an element of the first set is contained in the second set.

```{r }
x <- 1:10
y <- 5:15
x %in% y
```






## Summarization

Loads of functions take vector input and return scalar output.
Here are a few more...

```{r eval=FALSE}
x = 1:50
sum(x)
mean(x)
max(x)
length(x)
var(x)
```






## Data Frames

A data frame is like a table.
It can have as many rows and columns as you need.
Each column is a vector, and all the vectors have the same length.

```{r}
claims_data <- data.frame(insureds, premium, claim_count, claim_desc)
print(claims_data)
```



## Another data frame

```{r}
policies <- data.frame(
  pol_number = 1:10,
  prem = c(100, 110, 90, 120, 115, 60, 300, 30, 100, 95),
  age = c(21, 22, 32, 54, 34, 19, 70, 54, 42, NA)
)
```

  * Note the differences between this and the last slide
  * Pay attention to `<-` and `=`




## Functions for data frames

* `str`
* `names`
* `print`
* `head`
* `summary`



## Data frame subsetting and indexing

```{r}
teams  <- c("Toronto", "New York", "Baltimore", "Tampa Bay", "Boston")
wins   <- c(93, 87, 81, 80, 78)
losses <- c(69, 75, 81, 82, 84)

alEast <- data.frame(Team = teams, W = wins, L = losses)
```





## Selecting rows and columns

```{r, eval=FALSE}
alEast[1, ]
alEast[, 2]
alEast[, c('W', 'L')]
alEast[3] 
alEast[c(T, T, F, F, F), ]
alEast[alEast$Team == 'New York', ]
```

What happens on the last one if you leave off the comma?







## Other data structures

Most of the data you will be working with in R will be one of the following

+ data.frame
+ vector
+ list
  
You will also see some matrices and factors, but let's skip those for now.




## Okay, so what is a list, then?

+ A list is a bag of stuff
+ Everything in the list has an index (1, 2, 3, etc.)
+ The stuff can be anything
  * vectors
  * other lists
  * special objects
  * etc.
+ **Most modeling and other complex functions return lists**



## Lists


```{r }
x <- list()
typeof(x)
x[[1]] <- c("Hello", "there", "this", "is", "a", "list")
x[[2]] <- c(pi, exp(1))
summary(x)
str(x)
```




## List names

Names are handled with the special `$` operator. `$` permits access to a single element.
(A single element of a list can be a vector!)

```{r}
y <- list()
y$Artist <- c("Lou Reed", "Patti Smith")
y$Age <- c(45, 63)
names(y)
```






## Exercises

1. Create a vector of strings, you choose the strings and how many
1. Create another vector of the same length counting by 10s
1. Read the help page about the `rnorm` function
1. Build another vector with the same number of random numbers using `rnorm`
1. Put these three vectors together as a data frame
1. Run a summary function on the data frame
    + `str`
    + `summary`
    + etc.
