## Purpose

* We found the old Limited Attendance Seminar format was not practical enough
* People would come and listen, but maybe not actually *learn* much
* With R, **learning often comes from doing**
* So, we came up with a new format:
    + Half-day lecture
    + half-day practice


## Capstones

* We want you to go away from here having actually used R
* Hence the focus on the capstone project
* Two projects:
    + Ratemaking
    + Reserving
* The projects are designed to give you practice with *everything* we are teaching you



## Teams

* Usually, when we are in person, you can pick your own teams or do the project individually
* But, this week, we've picked your team for you
* Sorry, if that is not your thing...

## Office Hours

* These are not lectures
* They will be all interactive
* We are getting together with each group to introduce the capstones tomorrow, and go over any questions





## Ratemaking Capstone

**Since most of you are in the ratemaking capstone, so I'll introduce that now**

For the rest of you, Brian will introduce your capstone in "office hours" tomorrow



## What you'll get

* Policy data
* Claims data
* Rating data
* Reference data
* This data is all made up.
* It is for a fictitious claims-made Architects and Engineers program.  



## The project

* Load data into R
* Explore it
* Join it together and transform it, if needed
* Run modeling techniques on it to understand relationships
    + Linear models
    + Generalized linear models
    + Tree methods
* Document your work!


## Why?

You will use the following skills in the capstone project

  * general R skills, like indexing and arithmetic calculations
  * loading data files
  * visualization do to "exploratory data analysis"
  * dpylr for data manipulation
  * dpylr and base R for data aggregation
  * decision trees to guide analysis
  * glms for frequency model(s)
  * RMarkdown for report writing
  * curve fitting for severity distribution(s)
